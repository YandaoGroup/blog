你们脚本小子整天扫网站有意思吗？扫之前不做个指纹识别一下？AWVS 扫静态网站是不是有病，能扫出个鬼啊，静态网站连后台都没有，真不知道扫啥玩意儿
另外网站有日志的知道吗，AWVS 特征这么明显，你服务器高匿名了吗？非法扫描入侵违法的知道吗？真要扫搞个多层高匿服务器再来吧，虽然最后还是扫不出啥玩意。


Do you script kiddies have fun scanning websites all day? Don't do a fingerprint recognition before scanning? AWVS scan static website is not sick, can scan a ghost, static website does not even have a background, I really don't know what to scan
In addition, do you know that the website has logs? The AWVS feature is so obvious. Is your server highly anonymous? Do you know that illegal scanning is illegal? I really want to sweep up a multi-layer high-secret server and come back, although I still can't find anything in the end.
